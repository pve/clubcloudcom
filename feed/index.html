				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Agile development</strong> is all the fashion nowadays. Why is that and what kind of digital infrastructures does that require?</p>
<p>Back in the old days, business software was primarily written to automate <strong><em>existing</em></strong> business processes. Those processes might change somewhat as a result, but in the core processes were no different. Think accounting systems, scheduling, &#8220;customer relationship management&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>Today we see that software not only automates these business processes, but becomes part of the product, or even becomes the product itself. And on top of that, this software is often an on-line service. Think of the smart room thermostat. Or financial services, where software increasingly is the main part of the product: think online banking. And in social media from Facebook to Tindr, software really is the product.</p>
<h2>The dance</h2>
<p>Every product changes the world that uses it. Think how cars have changed the way people commute, or even choose where they live. Software is no different. But a changing world also changes the products we can use or want to use. There is a kind of dance between supply and demand. Do we have breakfast out of our house more often because there are more opportunities for this or does the supply of breakfast places increase as a result of us going out more? Just as in a dance, it is not always easy to tell who is leading who.</p>
<p>Because software now has become the product it will also participate in the dance, and then it becomes more important to quickly adapt to the dance partner. As a developer, you change the world that uses your software in ways you cannot always predict, so in reaction you have to adapt to that world.</p>
<p>The faster the better.</p>
<p>This explains the need for agile development. Between idea and realization (time to market) there should not be two years, but only two weeks, and preferably less.</p>
<h2>What kind of digital infrastructures does that require?</h2>
<p>The prime objective of digital infrastructures is to enable the deployment of application functionality. The quality of digital infrastructures used to be measured in the number of users it could support well. I.e. we used to talk about a system supporting 10.000 concurrent users with less than 4 seconds response time.</p>
<p>But agile development comes with a new goal: &#8216;feature velocity’. That is the speed with which new features can be deployed. The time between inception of a feature and its deployment to a large user base has to be shorter than the time it takes for the environment to change. In a dance you want to anticipate your partner, not stand on her toes.</p>
<p>Your digital infrastructure should not be a bottleneck. This requires features such as automated testing, quick scaling up and down of resources, and as little manual intervention as possible. This is the only way to shorten the lead time for a change.</p>
<h2>Cloud computing</h2>
<p>In summary: agile development requires cloud computing. Remember: the essential characteristics of cloud computing include fast, elastic and self-service provisioning of resources. That is what is required for agile development.</p>
<p>And then the dance continues. Because if we can do that, we can do other new things. Like better security. If you can respond quicker to new functional requirements, you can also respond quicker to security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Public cloud migrations come in different shapes and sizes, but I see three major approaches. Each of these has very different technical and governance implications.</p>
<h1>Three approaches</h1>
<p>Companies dying to get rid of their data centers often get started on a <strong>‘lift and shift’</strong> approach, where applications are moved from existing servers to equivalent servers in the cloud. The cloud service model consumed here is mainly IaaS (infrastructure as a service). Not much is outsourced to cloud providers here. Contrast that with SaaS.</p>
<p>The other side of the spectrum is adopting <strong>SaaS solutions</strong>. More often than not, these trickle in from the business side, not from IT. These could range from small meeting planners to full blown sales support systems.</p>
<p>More recently, developers have started to embrace <strong>cloud native architectures</strong>. Ultimately, both the target environment as well as the development environment can be cloud based. The cloud service model consumed here is typically PaaS.</p>
<p>I am not here to advocate the benefits of one over the other, I think there can be business case for each of these.</p>
<p>The categories also have some overlap. Lift and shift can require some refactoring of code, to have it better fit cloud native deployments. And hardly any SaaS application is stand alone, so some (cloud native) integration with other software is often required.</p>
<h1>Profound differences</h1>
<p>The big point I want to make here is that there are <strong>profound differences</strong> in the issues that each of these categories faces, and the hard decisions that have to be made. Most of these decisions are about <strong>governance and risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>With lift and shift, the application functionality is pretty clear, but bringing that out to the cloud introduces data risks and technical risks. Data controls may be insufficient, and the application’s architecture may not be a good match for cloud, leading to poor performance and high cost.</p>
<p>One group of SaaS applications stems from <strong>‘shadow IT’</strong>. The people that adopt them typically pay little attention to existing risk management policies. These can also add useless complexity to the application landscape. The governance challenges for these are obvious: consolidate and make them more compliant with company policies.</p>
<p>Another group of SaaS applications is the reincarnation of the <strong>‘enterprise software package’</strong>. Think ERP, CRM or HR applications. These are typically run as a corporate project, with all its change management issues, except that you don’t have to run it yourself.</p>
<p>The positive side of SaaS solutions, in general, is that they are likely to be cloud native, which could greatly reduce their risk profile. Of course, this has to be validated, and a minimum risk control is to have a good exit strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, cloud native development is the most <strong>exciting, rewarding and risky</strong> approach. This is because it explores and creates new possibilities that can truly transform an organization.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious balances to strike here is between speed of innovation and independence of platform providers. The more you are willing to commit yourself to an innovative platform, the faster you may be able to move. The two big examples I see of that are<strong> big data</strong> and <strong>internet of things</strong>. The major cloud providers have very interesting offerings there, but moving a fully developed application from one provider to another is going to be a really painful proposition. And of course, the next important thing is for developers to truly understand the risks and benefits of cloud native development.</p>
<p>Again, big governance and risk management issues to address.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past weeks I have been talking to a number of small software providers. Most software these days is no longer shipped (CD-ROMs are really oldskool, aren’t they?), but is delivered as a service over the internet.</p>
<p>These software providers are starting to realize that this means they are a SaaS provider. This also means that they have to do risk management like a cloud provider.</p>
<p>Among the companies I work with are an email/shopping cart provider and an e-learning provider.</p>
<p>With these companies I started by going through the CSA “Treacherous Twelve” list of top cloud risks. It does not matter much if you are a provider or a consumer, all risks can be relevant to both sides. The consumers have to protect themselves, and the providers have to enable them to do that.</p>
<p>In working with them I came across a number of interesting observations.</p>
<p>One guy stated: “only after reading through the Treacherous Twelve did I gain a more solid understanding of risks”.</p>
<p>Another guy said that he now started to understand how his security was essential to his customer’s security. In fact, being more explicit on what he did on risk management and security could actually be a selling point towards his customers.</p>
<p>He also said that the investors in his company would probably worry about this.</p>
<p>These companies start to realize that their customers are actually outsourcing some IT to them, and that these customers require some governance and risk management support. A simple case of that is that there is often some personal data of the customer’s employees or clients involved. If the provider messes up in managing that sensitive data, the customer gets burned.</p>
<p>At the same time, these software providers are often cloud consumers themselves, as they outsource their hosting and other services to other cloud providers. So the risk analysis cuts both ways.</p>
<p>Does some of this apply to your company? In that case you might want to look at the Treacherous Twelve study yourself. To dive deeper into that or if you need help, you might consider my <a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/virtual-ccsk-training/">cloud security training</a>, which can also earn you the Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I ran my first CCSP training session (I did more than 40 CCSK sessions before this). As of this writing, the attendants still have to do the exam. Apparently the exam slots are booked a few weeks in advance.</p>
<p>This was an in-company training with a pretty advanced group: info security consultants and a few of their clients, all of whom had experience in being a cloud consumer as well as having been involved on the cloud provider side. Half the group had already done CCSK.</p>
<p>The location was equally inspiring. Central London, with a great barista around the corner, which we therefore frequented multiple times a day for the entire week.<a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-02-15-10.22.24.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3714" src="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-02-15-10.22.24-300x169.jpg" alt="Barista" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-02-15-10.22.24-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-02-15-10.22.24-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The good news on cloud security is: it is interesting, dynamic, relevant and worthwhile stuff.</p>
<p>The bad news is: it is more complicated than you think.</p>
<p>The CCSP body of knowledge is significantly more elaborate than the CCSK one. And while the book is pretty reasonable, it does have its limitations.</p>
<p>We mused quite a bit about the adoption of cloud computing. Like any disruptive innovation, cloud computing is going to take 10-15 years to grow from zero to saturation. According to my guess, we are in year 3 or 4 of enterprise adoption, with 2021 or so as the target date for near complete adoption.</p>
<p>What we saw in the discussions was a lot of talk on ‘oldskool’ thinking versus ‘newskool’ thinking. Cloud brings a new thinking model, and in cloud security we see the biggest failures when oldskool controls are applied to newskool architectures.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LMS-1-2-oldskoop-newskool.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3715" src="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LMS-1-2-oldskoop-newskool-300x225.png" alt="LMS 1-2 oldskoop newskool" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LMS-1-2-oldskoop-newskool-300x225.png 300w, http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LMS-1-2-oldskoop-newskool.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Examples: location no longer implies control, and the uptime of a server no longer implies the uptime of the application.</p>
<p>It was really interesting to tear apart these assumptions and see which will carry over to the new world. The dangers of mixing these modes of thinking can go many ways: you either protect too much, the wrong way, or not at all.</p>
<p>The consequence of this is that in our training we really want to pay attention to the hidden assumptions of these two schools of thinking.</p>
<p>The CCSP body of knowledge itself is a product of its times: it is a peculiar mix of oldskool and newskool thinking, and mostly not very explicit about that. It also does not elaborate much on how ‘newskool’ thinking should be applied to create business benefits while avoiding the new risks.</p>
<p>But we should not confuse the messenger for the news. The text is just the messenger, cloud is the real news.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the next CCSP training session. What about letting me be your guide for one in your company? Drop me a line.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the recent Usenix Enigma 2016 conference, NSA TAO chief Rob Joyce explains how his team works. By the way, TAO means Tailored Access Operations, which is a euphemism for hacking. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDJb8WOJYdA" target="_blank">full presentation here</a>.  Rob explains their methods, but between the lines he implies that other nation states are doing the same, so in a way he is here to help us. For that reason he also explains what makes their work hard.</p>
<p>After Snowdon I should not need to explain the extent of what is going on here.</p>
<p>In summary, the NSA’s method of operation is: “reconnaissance, initial exploitation, establish persistence, move laterally, collect and exfiltrate”.</p>
<p>In this article I won’t go in more detail on each of these. But here are a couple of rephrased quotes for illustration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reconnaissance: “We aim to know your network (i.e. infrastructure) better than you do”</li>
<li>Initial exploitation: “Zero day exploits are hardly ever necessary”</li>
<li>Lateral moves: “Nothing frustrates us more than being inside, and not able to move”</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the implication of this for cloud security? Of course, if you replicate your legacy infrastructure into a cloud provider, it is not going to be more secure. So you need to do some more.</p>
<h2>Cloud to the rescue?</h2>
<p>Can the cloud model actually help with security? I think it can, and here are a few examples. They hinge on the cloud essential characteristics of self-service provisioning and rapid elasticity, which enable security automation.</p>
<p><strong>Know your network</strong>. A good IaaS provider allows you to fully and automatically take stock of what you have provisioned. A very small proof of concept is on <a href="https://github.com/pve/state-of-cloud" target="_blank">my github project &#8216;state of cloud&#8217;</a>, which just lists all running EC2 instances in your AWS account across all regions. You can then do all kinds of reporting and analysis on your infrastructure, and in particular check for vulnerabilities like rogue machines and open ports.</p>
<p><strong>Code exploits.</strong> Why should you use zero day exploits, if organizations are months or even years behind on patching? Why are they behind? Because it is labor intensive. So automate it. Whenever an instance boots up, it should be patched automatically and then tested. All without manual intervention. This requires cloud automation.</p>
<p><strong>Lateral moves</strong>. A typical organization has a hard shell, and a soft inside, so to say. Once passed the firewall, the attacker is like the fox in the henhouse. To counter this you need hyper segregation, in particular of security groups and user credentials. You can have a security group per machine, and individual credentials per task. Only cloud automation enables you to do this at scale.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hacking is an arms race. Automate and scale up your response or lose. Cloud computing might help.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you deliver your software product as a service? Or do you offer another IT service online? Then you probably have found that your customers really need assurance that your service is good enough for their purposes. It has to be usable of course, but it also has to fit in their risk appetite and compliance obligations.</p>
<p>During the service, or even in the process of procurement, your customer needs assurance. If not, they won’t remain your customer for very long.</p>
<p>Here is a sketch of a process that helps you demonstrate your quality to your customers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Figure out how the customer typically does assurance</strong>. Ask them. What are they scared of? Are they looking for specific certifications, audit reports or such? Think ISO27001, Cloud Controls Matrix, or staff certifications. You also want to figure out through what process they do this, if they have a process. Who is involved on the customer side? The IT security department? Internal audit? Corporate Risk Management? Your objective is to make their work in assessing your service as simple as possible. For example, a lot of companies are using the CAIQ format from the Cloud Security Alliance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. What proof of your quality do you already have?</strong> There is knowledge about your service, processes and assets, but also skills in handling these. How can you show that? You should also be honest about your attitude in service delivery. Is your company doing stuff because it is “the right thing” or because you are forced to do it? In particular you are looking for the things that you do well in a repeatable, documented way.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Gap analysis.</strong> Based on the output of step 1 and 2 you can get going on a gap analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your big security holes? I.e. do you allow your customers to do rotation of all login and API keys?</li>
<li>What are the evidence holes? For example: Is there logging missing, or not exposed well enough to the customer?</li>
<li>What process holes are there in your system? I.e. you may not have a repeatable process for tracking new security bugs or new compliance obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4. Talk to your customer.</strong> The ideal situation is where you can bring the results of the previous steps back to your customers and have an open dialogue about their requirements, desires and priorities. You want to figure out what the value is that the service is bringing them that offsets any residual risk that your service still poses to them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5. Improve, rinse and repeat.</strong> Feed the output of the previous step into your software development, your system and support organization, legal and sales. Make sure that whatever improvement they realize, they also build in the evidence that shows how it is an improvement. Status pages, dashboards, and self assessments (e.g. published under non-disclosure agreements) are good examples of that.</p>
<p>It does not stop here. Ideally you are in constant conversation with your customers about their new opportunities and new risks. As your service become more important to your customers, their risk appetite will change. You will need to address that.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this, download the cloud security 101 one-pager, and drop me a line with your specific question.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The internet changes the way we think, Nicholas Carr writes in “The Shallows”.</p>
<p>Simple examples can be found in what we decide to lookup instead of memorize, such as phone numbers. At the same time it still makes sense to study and memorize traffic signs and history.</p>
<p>But old truths don’t all hold anymore.</p>
<p>The internet changes our decisions on what to share to whom and what to keep secret. A lot of people are comfortable about sharing most of their feelings to the world, but it may be wise to be a bit more restrictive on sharing teenage party pictures, when you leave your house for a holiday, or your mother’s maiden name.</p>
<p>Not all old truths still hold.</p>
<p>Cloud computing changes the way we run professional IT. It changes our decisions on what we do ourselves and what we let others do for us.</p>
<p>Who owns the servers, who keeps the software safe? We can’t afford to run all of our interesting IT ourselves, but we don’t want to hand over everything. There are still things that we can do better than anybody else. So: less server hugging, and more useful applications that help our organizations stand out.</p>
<p>Old truths may need updating.</p>
<p>Want to know more? Have a <a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/calendar/">look at my calendar</a> for a free webinar where I will talk about this in more detail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Warning: this post is forward looking and does not give easy answers.</em></p>
<p>Cloud computing continues to enable innovation in the way we develop and deploy software.</p>
<p>Service Oriented Architecture (or SOA) is a software development paradigm for breaking up large systems into more manageable independent components. This probably got off in the nineties. As a matter of fact I worked on the architecture of a travel information system along those lines at the time.</p>
<p>Then we moved into multi-tier client server architectures, where a farm of web servers talks to a farm of application and database servers.</p>
<p>These days micro-services are the rage, each implementing a specific API to enable event driven software for full responsiveness.</p>
<p>However, micro-services still need to be deployed on compute units. This is one of the reasons why containers such as Docker’s are becoming so popular: they are much quicker to scale than virtual machine instances.</p>
<p>Yet, you are still deploying on discrete compute units. And while being able to scale up your resources is key to the cloud computing benefits, scaling down below the level of a compute unit makes it possible to think in terms of lots of smaller micro services. Maybe we should call them nano services.</p>
<p>The notion of the server, even if it is a container, then disappears, and the minimum cost for running a service drops from a dollar a day or so to millicents.</p>
<p>AWS Lambda is a new platform that enables this serverless computation style. The basic unit of deployment is a piece of code that handles one API request that can last no longer than a few seconds. The AWS platform does the replication and scaling. And billing of course, you can trust Amazon to do that :-).</p>
<p>The idea is not entirely new. Google App Engine did something similar 5 years ago, when I started measuring the cloud. However, it was too far out, lacked certain features to make it easy to use and deploy. In the meantime, it has made big steps, and Google App Engine  certainly remains an option in this space.</p>
<p>What is the strategic implication? This serverless computing style revolutionizes application architecture. We can now really start thinking in terms of service orientation and grid style computation, without being distracted by our target server architecture. At the same time, this requires significant reengineering of even the most advanced DevOps continuous deployment toolchains. And finally, security and risk management need to make some ‘adjustments’ in their thinking, to say the least.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the sequel to my introductory post &#8220;<a href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2015/09/it-leadership-in-the-21st-century/">IT leadership in the 21st century</a>&#8220;.</p>
<h2>IT Innovation and the bleeding edge</h2>
<p>When IT is being used to drive innovation, it is by definition on the ‘bleeding edge’. This is because proven technology is in wide use, and it will not lead to much competitive advantage. There is nothing wrong with proven technology. It just does not give you that leading edge.</p>
<p>There is a lot of proven technology in IT. We quite know how to build reliable hardware, and a lot of software layers have been battle tested for decades. The core of much of server land out there is Linux, which is a remake of a remake of Unix, which was in its 10<sup>th</sup> edition when I worked for a while at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in 1986. It would be an understatement to say that we sort of know how a good operating system kernel should look like. Even so, we are still regularly exposed to security bugs.</p>
<p>In programming languages the innovation is more recent. When I went to university Java was not yet invented. It is considered old school now. New programming languages still pop up in production, one example being Go (or golang) as developed at Google in 2009 (incidentally by people that I met at Bell Labs more than 30 years earlier).</p>
<p>Beyond programming languages we see innovation in the software delivery and deployment. Docker is the rage now, but it is not the end game.</p>
<p>You don’t need a lot of IT leadership for proven technology. There are no hard choices to make. You can just do what your peers do, or ask your supplier. And if you are on the bleeding edge, it is best to base that on proven technology as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Real digital innovation takes real digital leadership</h2>
<p>But real digital innovation takes real digital leadership. And this leadership has to both understand the business requirements as well as the entire path to the programmer who presses a button to deploy as well as the path from there to the customer’s screen. Of course, you need not understand every detail about it, but it pays to understand the general concepts, trade-offs and risks.</p>
<p>And generally speaking, right now the benefit is in feature velocity and the main risks are twofold. The first risk is in your own competence, the second is in smart adversaries hacking your system for personal data.</p>
<p>This is the new ground to break. That is the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More in a next post at which point we have to consider the social and organizational dimension of innovating with and within IT.</p>

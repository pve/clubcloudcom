<p>Over the past 4 years, I have conducted more than 50 multiday cloud training workshops. Here’s what attendees had to say.</p>
<ul>
<li>“The course provides a fantastic overview of Cloud and was an eye opener to me. The benefits of cloud were made clear, but so too were the limitations and considerations of the service.”</li>
<li>“The course provided an interesting insight into cloud security. Whilst i had pre-conceived concepts of cloud, this course proved to challenge these concepts.”</li>
<li>“Excellent tools for cloud computing audits. Practical examples of cloud providers and OpenStack helped to understand material.”</li>
<li>“Virtual learning online can have its own challenges such as ensuring that each person on the session is following what is being presented remotely by the trainer. Peter dealt with this very well by being inclusive with individually addressed audio comments to the participants.  He also encouraged feedback via chat which I believe is vital in maintaining bidirectional interaction.”</li>
<li>“Interactive sessions, Real world examples and analogies, providing context to discussions based on one’s background and aspirations.”</li>
<li>“The mixture of hands on and theory was a good balance.”</li>
<li>“I would recommend this course to everyone involved in Cloud from hands on IT to Executive.”</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../virtual-ccsk-training/index.html">Sign up here for the next virtual classroom.</a></p>
<h2>Read more feedback</h2>
<p>I could tell you how I have worked hard to make these workshops valuable, but you should not take my word for it.</p>
<p>Instead, look at the feedback I got from the participants who invested significant time and money. If you are considering a cloud (security) training or workshop, you might find inspiration in this summary. Then decide if this is something that would make sense for you too.</p>
<p>The first section is about the skills and knowledge people have acquired as a result of this training, the second section is about the class format (classroom or virtual). Most of the workshops were on CCSK (cloud security), but that training also covers a lot of general cloud topics. Finally, there are some comments on who else should take a course like this.</p>
<p>Regrettably, all these quotes are currently anonymous. I am working on attribution, but people in the security industry often are quite reluctant in sharing personal details. I guess it comes with the territory.</p>
<p>Finally, all these quotes are real, and I have only eliminated the most blatant typos.</p>
<h2><strong>What did people learn, and are now capable of applying?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Cloud is much more complex than most people appreciate &#8230; even me as an informed professional</li>
<li>The course provides a fantastic overview of Cloud and was an eye opener to me. The benefits of cloud were made clear, but so too were the limitations and considerations of the service.</li>
<li>New way of &#8220;thinking cloud&#8221; (e.g. cattle vs pet, use service as offered or take another one, &#8230;) was very well explained with real-life examples. Eye-opening!</li>
<li>The depth of Cloud Computing capabilities available today through the three different models of PaaS, IaaS and Saas. The security functionality of the different models was very interesting which prompted me to take a closer look at the operational infrastructure of AWS and in particular the variety of tools that they could support in the Cloud such as VPCs, IAM, HSMs.</li>
<li>Value comes in enabling me to speak to my clientele around security concerns and relate it back to what my organization does to mitigate security risks</li>
<li>Excellent tools for cloud computing audits. Practical examples of cloud providers and OpenStack helped to understand material</li>
<li>Setting architectural context with reference to security at regular points throughout the material was useful to me (as an architect and not a security person)</li>
<li>Helping to show how to define the value of cloud, including the risk profile to present to stakeholders.</li>
<li>Where to focus for the CCSK exam.</li>
<li>Resources for evaluating the security offerings of Cloud Vendors.</li>
<li>Fundamental concepts and spread of topics, and impression of exam format.</li>
<li>Four different cloud models and their use cases. Mapping exercise to support decision making process</li>
<li>I learn a lot more about the security in the cloud en that is very helpful. I hope I am able to pass the CCSK Exam with the knowledge I have learned in this training</li>
<li>That cloud is only a generic term for describing the next generation of computing, which is (self-) service based. That aside, the exercises which cover security controls in a AWS setting also helped.</li>
<li>Cloud is even bigger then imagined.</li>
<li>I have a clear understanding of the criteria and models you can apply when assessing a supplier.</li>
<li>The course underlined the importance of preparing appropriately for public cloud &#8211; from a business, strategy, architectural and security perspective. Also the importance of protecting the root AWS console! Also learned a few film quotes.</li>
<li>CCSK exam prep; real world scenarios</li>
<li>Principles of disruptive innovation, more insight in Cloud Computing in greater context</li>
<li>The journey to the cloud seen from different perspectives and the explanation of the ecosystem</li>
<li>Better understanding of the cloud architecture and the interrelationships between the different components (layers, domains, models).</li>
<li>The architectural perspective of cloud computing</li>
<li>It has been an eye opener in the vast array of products available from one Cloud Provider and the ease of configuration and deployment.</li>
<li>The course provided an interesting insight into cloud security. Whilst i had pre-conceived concepts of cloud, this course proved to challenge these concepts.</li>
<li>I will take cloud as relevant option to any solution/project I will be working on in the company. I learned some background of cloud computing, which will help me to consider cloud options in different light. More study required, of course, but that&#8217;s life 🙂</li>
<li>I have a more clear vision about security in the cloud and about the possibilities of what is possible in the cloud and what is not possible. This will work in my daily work at the [client] to convince application partner to change their application to a cloud application.</li>
<li>Good overview of CCSK. Overall better understanding of cloud security. More technical knowledge of AWS/OpenStack.</li>
<li>I have all the background I need to study for and pass the exam</li>
<li>Analogies are good and helpful. This helps me to explain this to other people and to clients. Real business examples are also very helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>About the instructor and class format</strong></h2>
<p>Note: these comments are from open classrooms, private classrooms as well as the virtual training.</p>
<ul>
<li>The instructor started with an overview that brings everyone up to the same baseline knowledge level &#8211; I found that really useful.</li>
<li>Virtual learning online can have its own challenges such as ensuring that each person on the session is following what is being presented remotely by the trainer. Peter dealt with this very well by being inclusive with individually addressed audio comments to the participants.  He also encouraged feedback via chat which I believe is vital in maintaining bidirectional interaction.</li>
<li>I really liked your enthusiasm and interaction. Having a smaller group was appreciated.<br />
Social part of the course was great, thx a lot! [note: classroom]</li>
<li>It was all good. The path of the course was clearly defined and stuck with the script. The leader was involving and used good analogies.</li>
<li>Interactive lessons and exercises.</li>
<li>Setting the context in terms of &#8220;what is cloud&#8221; promoted very good debate. Exploring real world examples within the delegates own organization.</li>
<li>The discussion and exercises on the differentiation of IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS worked very well on distinguishing the three concepts.</li>
<li>Structuring the broad field into manageable chunks.</li>
<li>Good balance between covering the entire field (structure) and filling in detail to illustrate the actual application. Between the course and the ancillary material, I feel comfortable to tackle the exam and continue my self-education.</li>
<li>Keep doing: combining theory and hands-on action, good speed, structure, interaction</li>
<li>Good: summaries, examples, relevant stories, recording of sessions, quiz questions, online support site</li>
<li>I like the breakdown of the content against the modules and the summaries. I really like how this is vendor neutral content and just general best practices.</li>
<li>Interactive sessions, Real world examples and analogies, providing context to discussions based on one’s background and aspirations</li>
<li>Peter, you have been very sufficient. 🙂</li>
<li>The subject knowledge of the Trainer was excellent, which was complemented by his long experience in the IT industry which helped provided interesting anecdotes to put various concepts in perspective.</li>
<li>Good knowledge of the material. nice person to have in front of the class</li>
<li>Peter prompts the candidates to think and challenge concepts and provided overviews of the domains in a clear and easy to understand manner</li>
<li>The trainer supported the training with real life scenarios to which all of us could relate to, this bought the training to life and allowed good open conversation. Time was taken to ensure our requirements were met throughout the course duration.</li>
<li>Personable, knowledgeable and approachable. Welcomed the discussions we had both directly relating to the material and sometimes more generally around the topic.</li>
<li>Good sense of humor, engaging and lots of real life examples.</li>
<li>The trainer&#8217;s real world experience was very interesting and relevant. The trainer&#8217;s balanced view of the advantages and disadvantages of cloud was pragmatic and helpful</li>
<li>Peter clearly has a great deal of specific industry experience and draws on this to provide real-world examples. Always happy to divert the conversation out of the course where relevant and interesting within the cloud computing context. I think this was particularly useful and observed this providing value to the entire group.</li>
<li>Excellent host and knowledgeable representative of the CSA CCSK Training, delivered good information and linked that knowledge to industry bodies and gave good thought process behind the standardization of the Cloud processes and benefits that this environment can deliver vs conventional IT Practices</li>
<li>Trainer was extremely knowledgeable and well prepared. Provided examples that clarified key concepts.</li>
<li>Concise, organized, professional, easy to hear and understand.</li>
<li>Presentations are clear and style is good.</li>
<li>Keep the discussions/interactions/social stuff (dinner together on the first day).</li>
<li>Really enjoyed the course, was a good introduction and overview of the concepts around Cloud Security</li>
<li>The training group worked well together, and was also fun to work with.</li>
<li>I have never done virtual training before and it is hard to get as engaged and get interaction; however I think this has been done well so far. I would appreciate a bit more focus on the exam throughout as, whilst the point of the training is to be better in our jobs, sadly we need the exam&#8230;</li>
<li>Good content which makes the participant think about many of the domain and interlinkage between them.</li>
<li>The mixture of hands on and theory was a good balance. Running a private course worked really well as it meant we could have candid discussions about relevant and live situations</li>
<li>Good Service from the Instructor with allowing discussions around personal challenges in the team and assurance that the members all had their own reservations about how to handle the cloud.</li>
<li>a big thanks to Peter for a most interesting course.</li>
<li>Thanks for the training &#8211; it have been three days well spent.</li>
<li>Thanks for coming over! [private onsite]</li>
<li>2h format was good. [virtual]</li>
<li>Thoroughly organized training addressing the individual Group needs as much as possible. Highly competent trainer with a lot of experience.</li>
<li>Instructor is knowledgeable, fun and flexible in discussing topics</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Who else should do this?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>I would recommend this course to everyone involved in Cloud from hands on IT to Executive. The course did assume some pre-requisite technical knowledge, which I wasn&#8217;t prepared i.e. I am not too familiar with command lines and use of Putty etc.  That said, this was one of the most informative courses I have attended.</li>
<li>Very good training. I would recommend the training to others.</li>
<li>I would recommend this training to my colleagues</li>

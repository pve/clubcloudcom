				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, so the end of the world hasn&#8217;t happened yet. Trust me, it will, one day.</p>
<p>In the meantime Internettters are preparing for the inevitable demise of IPv4. On June 6 major websites will turn on IPv6, which they have avoided so far in fear of brokenness at clients.</p>
<p>To see how well prepared you are for IPv6 day, have a look at the following sites:</p>
<p>http://ipv6test.nl/demo.php<br /><a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">http://test-ipv6.com/</a><br /><a href="http://ipv6-test.com/">http://ipv6-test.com/</a></p>
<p>By the way, my IPv6 link is consistently faster than my IPv4 link.</p>
<p>Finally a bit of embedded stuff to automatically give you some IP information.</p>
<p><!-- IPv6-test.com widget BEGIN --><br /><script type="text/javascript">var _ipv6test_widget_style = {border: "solid 1px #000",font_size: "12px",show_country_flags: true,show_loading_anim: true,ipv4_label_color: "#393",ipv4_background_color: "#eee",ipv6_label_color: "#339",ipv6_background_color: "#ddd",stats_position: "bottom",stats_font_size: "10px",stats_color: "#eee",stats_color_v4: "#beb",stats_color_v6: "#bbe",stats_background_color: "#666"}</script></p>
<div id="_ipv6test_widget" style="width:250px;display:none">loading <a href="http://ipv6-test.com/">IPv6 connection test</a> &#8230;</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Google (<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics/</a>) native IPv6 penetration has structurally crossed the 0.2% mark as a percentage of total traffic on the Internet in early 2011. This may not seem much, but it has doubled in a year, in an Internet that is still growing exponentially.</p>
<p>Tunneled traffic has decreased, which is good. Yet, it looks like native traffic is only replacing this, not adding to it. This could mean that native IPv6 is only gaining share within a stabilizing population.</p>
<p>Daily variations indicate a bias towards home usage, as percentages are higher on weekends, although this bias has decreased somewhat over the years.</p>
<p>Let us contrast this with the AMS-IX statistics at&nbsp;http://www.ams-ix.net/sflow-stats/ether/bps/log&nbsp;which appear to be flat line. This is by ethernet type, which is likely to be native IPv6 traffic rather than tunneled. One hypotheses is that IPv6 penetration grows by regions adopting it, other regions would then be catching up to the penetration levels in Europe.</p>
<p>Overall, the message is mixed. IPv6 is growing in maturity, but not necessarily in adoption.</p>
<p>What is your reflection on this?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="MsoNormal">We are running out of IPv4 Internet addresses, but who is using them all up? The IP address space usage per capita differs greatly between nations, which points to a digital divide.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">If we would distribute IPv4 addresses uniformly over the world population, there would be less than 1 address per person. In fact, on the average, 0.54 addresses would be available per person (including all babies, etc). In 2006 this number was 0.57, population has increased in the meantime. The actual use is 0.45 (up from 0.32 in 2006). For a more detailed analysis of this history, see my 2006 analysis at <a title="[network] The digital divide on IP addresses" href="http://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/2006/01/network-the-digital-divide-on-ip-addresses/">this link</a>.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">But addresses are not uniformly distributed. There is a digital divide between western countries and developing countries. The top user (not counting some mini states) is the US, where wasteful pre-CIDR address allocations have led to an average of more than 4 addresses per person. A few dozen countries have more than their fair share (i.e. 0.54) addresses per person, and almost two dozen have more that 1 address per person allocated.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Utilization is still growing rapidly. Over 30, mostly developing, countries have more than doubled their address utilization per capita in the past 4 years. In addition, most developed countries (with the notable exception of the US) have seriously (30-60%) increased their utilizations.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">This growth is clearly unsustainable within the IPv4 address space. Not every country can have these utilization levels. The hunger for new addresses is greatest in China (currently at 1 IPv4 address per 4 inhabitants) and India (1 address per 53 inhabitants). To put these at the modest level of 1 address per inhabitant requires more than 2.2 billion addresses, where there are currently only 290 million left, according to <a href="http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/">http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/</a>. Given these numbers and the overall strong growth, any hopes of being able to reuse space that is allocated but not used (i.e. pre-CIDR) are futile. This demand dwarfs the entire US allocation.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><iframe src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AviIbs_TLVWQdENHRWF0eUhnOGR4UnZ0VjFsb1RGVWc&amp;output=html&amp;chrome=false&amp;widget=true&amp;hl=en" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="260px"></iframe></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">IPv6 is supposed to solve the address space problem. Is it progressing? For IPv6 allocations the per capita metric is a bit moot as there is no scarcity. Still, there is an interesting divide. Quite a number of countries have no allocated IPv6 address space at all. A few have pilots, with utilizations less than 1 percent. The largest utilizations are in Sweden and in the Asia Pacific region, where a number of countries have hundreds of IPv6 blocks (/64 each) per inhabitant. The US is in 8<sup>th</sup> place, after Vietnam and Indonesia but, somewhat surprisingly, before China.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The full data of this analysis can be found in a Google Docs spreadsheet, see http://twurl.nl/q416tl</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">I’d also like to acknowledge Iljitsch van Beijnum who has provided the address allocation data. <a href="http://www.bgpexpert.com/addrspace2009.php">http://www.bgpexpert.com/addrspace2009.php</a></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am through with IPv6.</p>
<p>By now all my websites (that I know off) are dual stack with native, untunneled IPv6. Thanks to <a href="http://xs4all.nl/">Xs4all.nl</a> and AVM.de (the FritzBox guys) I have native IPv6 in my home office. Setup was a breeze. On <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">http://test-ipv6.com/</a> my connection scores 10/10 for IPv6 readiness.</p>
<p>I have had a lot to do with the Dutch government. Currently the main site <a href="http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/">www.rijksoverheid.nl</a> is fully IPv6 capable, and for the internal network the decision to enable IPv6 has been made at the top, and is now trickling down into the it departments. This is going to save them a fortune by reducing NAT (Network Address Translation). I can tell you from first hand experience.</p>
<p>So for now, my mission is accomplished. If you need help rooting out isolated pockets of resistance, give me a call.</p>

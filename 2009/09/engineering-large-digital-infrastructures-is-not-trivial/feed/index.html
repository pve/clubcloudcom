		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Admittedly, I think it a bad idea to perform this kind of maintenance in the middle of the day in North America (which I imagine has more GMail users than most other regions, on a traffic basis). But hey, who am I? Besides, if they&#039;ve done it before successfully, and I imagine they do it a lot, it&#039;s only a problem when something goes wrong.]]></description>

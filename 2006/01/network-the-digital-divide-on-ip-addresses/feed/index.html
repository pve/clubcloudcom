		<description><![CDATA[&gt;The need is still there. The analysis shows that a new technology would be needed. Your hypothesis that these developing countries will be the early mass adopters for IPv6 is very valid. By the same reasoning one would expect mobile operators to take the lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another correspondent pointed at &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://www.unicttaskforce.org/perl/documents.pl?id=1314&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;The analysis of future need is slightly flawed though. It&#039;s somewhat like saying at the turn of the century (the other century) that there wouldn&#039;t be enough whale capacity to support developing countrys&#039; demand for blubber. By the time the problem became acute, the problem could be bypassed by  going straight to the new technology (petroleum).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing countries don&#039;t (in general) ]]></description>
